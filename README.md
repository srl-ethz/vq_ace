# VQ-ACE: Efficient Policy Search for Dexterous Robotic Manipulation via Action Chunking Embedding

The code framework is adapted from [srl_il](https://github.com/srl-ethz/srl_il)

## Get started

The following is tested on Ubuntu22.04

```bash
conda create -n vq_ace python=3.11 # or other versions of python
conda activate vq_ace

git clone git@github.com:srl-ethz/vq_ace.git
cd vq_ace
pip install -e .
```

## Training


Train the action chunk embeddings without vector quantization.

```bash
python3 scripts/run_pipeline.py --config-name=train_embed_act
```

Train the action chunk embeddings with vector quantization.

```bash
python3 scripts/run_pipeline.py --config-name=train_embed_vq_act
```

Train the action chunk embeddings with vector quantization, but without conditions

```bash
python3 scripts/run_pipeline.py --config-name=train_embed_vq_act
```
